noflo-3dprint allows you to 3d print objects from [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org).

It is designed to communicate with software/service that does the actual printing work,
typically using a REST API.

Supports [CuraServer](http://github.com/jonnor/CuraServer) for slicing
and [OctoPrint](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint) for printer control.

Combined with [noflo-cad](http://github.com/jonnor/noflo-cad) you can also
build parametric 3d-models with NoFlo.
